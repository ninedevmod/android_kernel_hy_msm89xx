	  Binder is used in Android for both communication between processes,
	  and remote method invocation.

	  This means one Android process can call a method/routine in another
	  Android process, using Binder to identify, invoke and pass arguments
	  between said processes.

	  Binder is used in Android for both communication between processes,
	  and remote method invocation.

	  This means one Android process can call a method/routine in another
	  Android process, using Binder to identify, invoke and pass arguments

	  Default value for the binder.devices parameter.

	  The binder.devices parameter is a comma-separated list of strings
	  that specifies the names of the binder device nodes that will be
	  created. Each binder device has its own context manager, and is
	  therefore logically separated from the other devices.

config ANDROID_BINDER_IPC_SELFTEST
        bool "Android Binder IPC Driver Selftest"
        depends on ANDROID_BINDER_IPC
        ---help---
          This feature allows binder selftest to run.

          Binder selftest checks the allocation and free of binder buffers
          exhaustively with combinations of various buffer sizes and
          alignments.
